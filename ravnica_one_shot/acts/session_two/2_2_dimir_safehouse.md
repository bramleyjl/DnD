# Session 2
## Scene 2 - Dimir Safehouse

> Walk up the spiral staircase you are confronted at the top with smooth, well-maintained wooden door. On the other side appears to be some sort cellar or basement, the cool air indicating that you're still underground. Or perhaps "prison" would be more apt, with the floor-to-ceiling bars to one side and neat (except for the blood) rack of torture implements on the other.

* The party comes up the stairs to a small interrogation chamber that is devoid of anything besides the cage and a small rack of pliers, hammers, hooks, etc. used to torture victims of the Dimir for their information. In the back there is a rickety staircase that deposits you in the back of a halway, to the left another stair case continues up, straight ahead there appears to be another door with a little light coming out of it.

### Downstairs

* Downstairs is a print shop.

### Upstairs
* Upstairs they will encounter Vessmer immediately, as he is in the safehouse's living quarters reading correspondance. If encountered with the krasis he will immediately be somewhat suspicious and demand to know who they are and why they have his krasis several days early, with a little prompting he will reveal that Kismus (The Rag Man) was supposed to be bringing over the beast himself for the demonstration?
    * Vessmer is a tall, gaunt-looking man in incredbly-numerously layered robes that appear like in sum they weigh a ton.
    * Absent a sufficiently good explanation he will immediately attack. With one he will interrogate further, asking for a complete account of how they know Kismus and the timeline of them bringing the krasis to him.
        * So is the beast ready? It has the modifications that our pet biomancer (Zendoria) promised? If pressed on this he will reveal details about Gruul wilds and the secret lab there.
        * How can we tell? It doesn't look different than any of the other Simic beasts.
        * If they bluff *too well* he will sigh and say that he will have to punish Kismus for revealing so much detail to hired help and attack.
        * He will eventually tire of conversation and demand that they deposit the beast there and fuck off. Refusal will result in immediate combat.

* The safehouse looks like an efficiently-used above-commercial living quarters, with a neat pair of sturdy bunk-beds, a utilitarian cast-iron stove in the center for heat and cooking, a table, several shelving units with a variety of gear for spycraft (grappling hooks, a pair of spyglasses, throwing weapons, crossbow bolts, and arrows, small sticks of charcoal and ledgers for taking notes, etc), and the desk that Vessmer was seated at when you entered.
    * The desk contains a variety of above and underground maps, as well as writing equipment and several large folders of paper, most of which seem to be related to the press shop below. Invoices and tally sheets for orders of various manuscripts, advertisement flyers, and the like. *INT 15* will reveal that there seem to be additional orders inserted that aren't accounted for in the financial logs.
