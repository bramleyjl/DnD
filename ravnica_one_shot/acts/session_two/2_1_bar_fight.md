# Session 2
## Scene 1 - Bar Fight

> Heading further south and out of the (slightly) less murderous parts of the Sixth, their most recent murder notwithstanding, you find yourselves in what can only be described as a Rakdos 'hood. While Dante has certainly seen it all and Topher has probably seen much of it, "it" is the definitely the kind of thing that goes on at Keever's Kleavers. Keevers is the kind of joint that you'd usually get real fucked up at *before* going to a real Rakdos show on the chance that you end up as one of the participants and suddenly need the pain-killing properties of alcohol more than you need the buzz. It's a narrow dive fighting for every inch of space it can get on its corner of the street. The first floor is empty except for the bar along the wall: maximum floorspace for the often impromptu pain shows that start. There's several more levels of more conventionally crammed bar seating above it, with no bar itself. You want a drink (or to leave) during a show, you're gonna have to get near a show. Right now the bar is still sparsely populated, a few small groups clustered together at the bar or on the floor, with a low murmur from the starirs indicating a similar amount of patrons upstairs.

* On entering, the party will `Wisdom - 10` get a few odd looks if they have the krasis with them. Otherwise perception will reveal nothing. `Keever` is a heavily tattoo'd and scarred man with his namesake cleavers hanging at his sides. Friendly and affable, he loudly exclaims "Well hey there Ribbard!" as you approach. He calmly explains that he knew Aeranor and the krasis, too.
    * General: As party questions him start rolling against DC 17 that a pain show will start, adding +1 on each question/topic (loose) after the first.
    * Aeranor: Not surprised that he's dead, he "knew the type": some say down on their luck, he says lucky to lived as long as he has. Good customer though, for a man supposedly in debt he spent a lot on booze.
    * Penaleus: Saw the Orzhov ponce in here before, once, maybe twice? Both time with Aeranor, then had the good sense to leave before the show started or he would have been eaten alive. Probably literally.
    * Rag Man: no idea
    * Krasis: (MENTION MUCUS TO CLUE PARTY IN) Aeranor showed up with him a few times, it was weird, but not *weird* weird. Lots of crazy shit ends up in this bar. Cute, in its own fucked up way. First he said he found it, no idea what it was or where it came from. Came back later and said it was Simic (duh). Later came back and was drinking HARD. Said it came from the Simic (duh), but not really (no idea what that means). Said they're gonna get fucked by this little fucker, or another one like it, they'll be completely owned and they won't even know it. Was very scared.
    * Debt: He always bitched about his debt. Was talking more and more about trying to run from it entirely before he found this Ribbard thing and then he was talking about how he was gonna free and clear.
    * Ask specifically about where Aeranor lived/`Charisma 10` will get him to describe rough directions of where to look for where Aeranor was staying in the rubblebelt. Said he was roughing it in some actual ruins, real Gruul-style shit. Maybe trying to get off the grid from the Orzhov?

* Let party comb the rest of the 2 floors, with `Charisma 10` they can get a few recognitions of `Ribbird` from more regular members but nothing more about Aeranor, apparently he was something of a loner. `Perception 15` against their passive perception will detect the Man in Rags
    * ### Chase Scene
        * Pain show crew: Party will have to get through the ongoing pain show to cross the bar's floor and follow the Man in Rags out into the street. [ADD PAIN SHOW CREW LINK HERE]
        * Dynamic chase: think of the chase from the Man In Rags' perspective: He's a Dimir agent that now knows for sure he hasn't tied up all of the loose ends to this. He wants to escape to his safe house so that he can lose the party and then plan for their murder later.
            * General setting: Dark, so relatively quiet streets but Rakdos area so more nocturnal (and psycho) activity than in other parts of the city. Some nighttime vendors, the occasional watchman, groups of revelers, etc.
            * If Man In Rags gets sufficienty far away (> 100 ft?) he will attempt a hide check and the party will have to beat it with their perception or he'll sucessfully escape.
            * Encounter (tone numbers down slightly): https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/13185375-8d45-448d-b681-b471ba73bae3
            * Chase details/checks:
                * Man In Rags casts spell on closest member to fuck with others further behind:
                * Push through a crowd in an alley
                * If Man In Rags is > 50 feet ahead have a T intersection where they have to guess which way he went
                * Run through a night market with additional places to hide
                * After 3-5 mini-encounters/rolls have Man In Rags make it to sewer entrance for safehouse
        * Safehouse:
            > The man turns yet another blind alley and is gone again, this time seeming to disappear into thin air.
                * `Wisdom 15` will let party member hear, see, or smell (+2 for any specific sense mentioned) evidence that there is a sewer grate that looks recently disturbed. Following down it you will hear splashing of feet with another `Wisdom 15` or else be able to follow a `Wisdom 12` blood trail if the Man in Rags was wounded. Party can still track him down before he makes it to safe house if they make a *Survival 15* check, else he makes it inside.
                * Succeeding on either of the earlier checks take them to the safehouse entrance, if they fail both then a *Surivavl 20* check will pick up the trail. If they fail that then they have nothing (prompt them to review and follow up on Aeranor's living in the Rubblebelt)

## Moving On

* If party gets name `Keaver's Kleavers` from Penaleus then they know they should go to Keever's Kleavers since Aeranor was known to hang around here.

* If party doesn't have the name of the bar they will have to ask around about a `sadistic gore house` and `expensive/fancy man with 2 thrulls` to eventually put together that Penaleus was seen around Keaver's Kleavers, this will take several days.
