# Session 2
## Scene 1 - Bar Fight

> Heading further south and out of the (slightly) less murderous parts of the Sixth, their most recent murder notwithstanding, you find yourselves in what can only be described as a Rakdos 'hood. While Dante has certainly seen it all and Topher has probably seen much of it, "it" is the definitely the kind of thing that goes on at Keever's Kleavers. Keevers is the kind of joint that you'd usually get real fucked up at *before* going to a real Rakdos show on the chance that you end up as one of the participants and suddenly need the pain-killing properties of alcohol more than you need the buzz. It's a narrow dive fighting for every inch of space it can get on its corner of the street. The first floor is empty except for the bar along the wall: maximum floorspace for the often impromptu pain shows that start. There's several more levels of more conventionally crammed bar seating above it, with no bar itself. You want a drink (or to leave) during a show, you're gonna have to get near a show. Right now the bar is still sparsely populated, a few small groups clustered together at the bar or on the floor, with a low murmur from the starirs indicating a similar amount of patrons upstairs.

* On entering, the party will `Wisdom - 10` get a few odd looks if they have the krasis with them. Otherwise perception will reveal nothing. `Keever` is a heavily tattoo'd and scarred man with his namesake cleavers hanging at his sides. Friendly and affable, he loudly exclaims "Well hey there Ribbard!" as you approach. He calmly explains that he knew Aeranor and the krasis, too.
    * General: As party questions him start rolling against DC 17 that a pain show will start, adding +1 on each question/topic (loose) after the first. As they get closer to it starting put in mentions of a crowd gathering and a pair of naked-to-the-waist with red (blood?) and black facepainted men, apparently blade jugglers of some sort, are addressing them.
    * Aeranor: Not surprised that he's dead, he "knew the type": some say down on their luck, he says lucky to lived as long as he has. Good customer though, for a man supposedly in debt he spent a lot on booze.
    * Penaleus: Saw the Orzhov ponce in here before, once, maybe twice? Both time with Aeranor, then had the good sense to leave before the show started or he would have been eaten alive. Probably literally.
    * Rag Man: no idea
    * Krasis: (MENTION MUCUS TO CLUE PARTY IN) Aeranor showed up with him a few times, it was weird, but not *weird* weird. Lots of crazy shit ends up in this bar. Cute, in its own fucked up way. First he said he found it, no idea what it was or where it came from. Came back later and said it was Simic (duh). Later came back and was drinking HARD. Said it came from the Simic (duh), but not really (no idea what that means). Said they're gonna get fucked by this little fucker, or another one like it, they'll be completely owned and they won't even know it. Was very scared.
    * Debt: He always bitched about his debt. Was talking more and more about trying to run from it entirely before he found this Ribbard thing and then he was talking about how he was gonna free and clear.
    * Ask specifically about where Aeranor lived/`Charisma 10` will get him to describe rough directions of where to look for where Aeranor was staying in the rubblebelt. Said he was roughing it in some actual ruins, real Gruul-style shit. Maybe trying to get off the grid from the Orzhov?

* Let party comb the rest of the 2 floors, with `Charisma 10` they can get a few recognitions of `Ribbird` from more regular members but nothing more about Aeranor, apparently he was something of a loner. `Perception 15` against their passive perception will detect the Man in Rags. When detected he will immediately try to escape.
    * > You can't help but shake the feeling that someone in the growing crowd has their eyes on you. You crane your neck around a few times and finally catch the quick head-nod of someone that had been looking intently in your direction and suddenly wanted to appear to be doing anything but.
    * Man in Rags: Hard to make out but man in "ragged-looking robes" would be better description, not quite beggar level but definitely looking like he's down on his luck and has been living hard recently. Hood of robes pulled over head so you cant see much more than the lack of a beard. 
    * ### Chase Scene
        * Pain show: If show has started the first person to make a big/dramatic/obvious action will prompt a response from one of the `Blade Brothers` that the show is just beginning and that they can't leave just yet. Brothers will begin making dagger attacks against both MiR and party. 
        * Dynamic chase: think of the chase from the Man In Rags' perspective: He's a Dimir agent that now knows for sure he hasn't tied up all of the loose ends to this. He wants to escape to his safe house so that he can lose the party and then plan for their murder later.
            * General setting: Dark, so relatively quiet streets but Rakdos area so more nocturnal (and psycho) activity than in other parts of the city. Some nighttime vendors, the occasional watchman, groups of revelers, etc.
            * If Man In Rags gets sufficienty far away (> 100 ft?) he will attempt a hide check and the party will have to beat it with their perception or he'll sucessfully escape.
            * Encounter (tone numbers up slightly): https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/13185375-8d45-448d-b681-b471ba73bae3 
            * Chase details/checks:
                * Does a hide/sneak attack combo
                * Push through a crowd in an alley
                * If Man In Rags is > 50 feet ahead have a T intersection where they have to guess which way he went
                * Run through a night market with additional places to hide
                * After 3-5 mini-encounters/rolls have Man In Rags make it to sewer entrance for safehouse
            * Man in Rags will fight to the death or kill himself rather than be taken alive. *Wisdom 10* will note the wear on his clothes and boots (boots are also wet from sewer), and *Wisdom/Int 15* can indicate a possible area of the Golgari or Gruul lands further to the south and east.
                * Appearence: human, age difficult to tell from heavy amount of scarring on face, maybe that's he's clothed all in rags? His body has blue and black tattoos that an *Intelligence 15* will interpret to folk/nonsense charms professional thieves and spies often get
                * Captured: Man in Rags will refuse to engage with party, and when given the opportunity make a Sleight of Hand check to poison himself to prevent givin up information
                * Possessions
                    * dagger
                    * money pouch with 2d6 gold and 1d4 silver
                    * encoded thought: "Proof is demanded of our work. Bring a specimen to me, night of the new moon (night after nextr), use the underground entrance"
                    * small leather pouch with a few corked beakers and herbs. *Int 15* reveals that there are a number of powerful elixirs that could be created with them as well as a number of deadly poisons/efficient ways to kill someone. Also in one pouch pocket are 3 silver extraordinarily battered coins and a small scrap of paper: `unblinkingeye` -> `xqeolqnlqjhbh`
        * Safehouse:
            > The man turns yet another blind alley and is gone again, this time seeming to disappear into thin air.

                * `Wisdom 15` will let party member hear, see, or smell (+2 for any specific sense mentioned) evidence that there is a sewer grate that looks recently disturbed. Following down it you will hear splashing of feet with another `Wisdom 15` or else be able to follow a `Wisdom 12` blood trail if the Man in Rags was wounded. Party can still track him down before he makes it to safe house if they make a *Wisdom 15* check, else he makes it inside.
                * Succeeding on either of the earlier checks take them to the safehouse entrance, if they fail both then a *Wisdom 20* check will pick up the trail. If they fail that then have them discover MiR's stash in the entrance area, hidden in the opening of a nonfunctioning pipe there is a tightly sealed box that a *Wisdom 12* will reveal, containing
                    * caesar cipher paper `xqeolqnlqjhbh` & 3 silver battered coins
                    * rough map to safehouse location
                    * 2d4 gold
                    * traveling gear, pack with supplies, heavy mud-slattered boots, heavy cloak, climbing/rappeling supplies
            > An especially narrow pice of sewer, far away from any natural light source. Party member notices that a bit of wall looks a little off, almost too new or clean to belong to the rest. Party investigating will have a glyph of [Fear](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fear#content) cast on all of them, plus a phantom monster to fight with. Once they realize the trick an *Int 15* check can realize the stone wall is an illusion for what appears to be an equally-stone and unmovable but quiet smooth and pristine stone wall behind it. Figuring out the passphrase will cause a Dimir signet to slowly fade into view on the surface of the wall before the stone silently slides down and reveals a narrow staircase that travels back a few feet before appearing to spiral up into the darkness.

## Moving On

* If the party accesses the Dimir Safehouse they can go there, if not then the Rubblebelt
