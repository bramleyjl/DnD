# Session 2
## Scene 2 - Dimir Safehouse

> Walking up the spiral staircase you are confronted at the top with a smooth, well-maintained wooden door. On the other side appears to be some sort cellar or basement, the cool air indicating that you're still underground. Or perhaps "prison" would be more apt, with the floor-to-ceiling bars to one side and neat (except for the blood) rack of torture implements on the other.

* The party comes up the stairs to a small interrogation chamber that is devoid of anything besides the cage and a small rack of pliers, hammers, hooks, etc. used to torture victims of the Dimir for their information. In the back there is a rickety staircase that deposits you in the back of a halway, to the left another stair case continues up, straight ahead there appears to be another door with a little light coming out of it.

### Downstairs

* Downstairs is a print shop. On one side of the room there are rows of individual print blocks neatly laid out in alphabetical order next to a large steam-powered mechanical printing press that currently sits idle, a stack of the latest edition of some obscure-sounding *Ravnican Record*, an ostensibly-unbiased periodical that seems primarily concerned with the "obvious" corruption that it charges is "flowing out of New Prahv with every drop of ink codifying a new unneccesary law". The other seems to be the management & business side of the business. Neatly filed copies of old work should the need arise to recreate a past order, maps, invoices, the like. There is also a small desk, table, and lockbox (bolted into the table which is itself bolted to the floor) - this appears to be where prices are haggled, short-term paperwork is stored, etc.
    * Investigating the working area reveals
        * The invoice papers for printing a thousand copies of an illustrated (expensive!) advertisement for a supposedly revolutionary new saddle design are what appear to be the most recent topic of attention. There are also some draft copies of the latest *Ravnican Record* and some law books that *Intelligence 10* reveals to have something to do with pet & animal ownership laws, and *Wisdom 15* will reveal faint impressions/grooves (from a dry quill) or someone underlying passages referring possession laws regarding ownership of a newly divergent species.
    * Looking for "anything that seems recently disturbed" and getting a Wisdom 12 or higher will reveal:
        * One paper folder not fully put away in the archives includes some relatively recently (within the last few months it appears) geological surveys done of sections of the Rubblebelt, *Int* 10 or more will reveal that these areas appear to be further out in this area of the 10th, namely a day or so's journey further south after crossing a stretch of Golgari lands.

### Upstairs

* Upstairs they will encounter Vessmer immediately, as he is in the safehouse's living quarters reading correspondance. If encountered with the krasis he will immediately be somewhat suspicious and demand to know who they are and why they have his krasis several days early, with a little prompting he will reveal that Kismus (The Rag Man) was supposed to be bringing over the beast himself for the demonstration?
    * Vessmer is a tall, gaunt-looking man with thin black hair that clings to his skull, and wears incredbly-numerously layered robes that appear like in sum they weigh a ton. *Int 12* reveals he is a lesser vampire though still (remotely) from Szadek's lineage.
    * Absent a sufficiently good explanation he will immediately attack. With one he will interrogate further, asking for a complete account of how they know Kismus and the timeline of them bringing the krasis to him.
        * Let me guess, he's tying up that "lose end" of his that he said might make him miss the deadline? But if so then why so early?
        * So is the beast ready? It has the modifications that our pet biomancer (Zendoria) promised? If pressed on this he will reveal details about Gruul wilds and the secret lab there.
        * Location: past Svogthos into the Gruul wilds, away from prying eyes and we didn't want any of the beasts managing to get all the way back to Novigen in case they got out
        * How can we tell? It doesn't look different than any of the other Simic beasts.
        * If they bluff *too well* he will sigh and say that he will have to punish Kismus for revealing so much detail to hired help and attack.
        * He will eventually tire of conversation and demand that they deposit the beast there and fuck off. Refusal will result in immediate combat.
    * If Vessmer's health is reduced below half during combat he will attempt to flee in order to warn higher ups about the possibility of the plot being spoiled and to attempt to find a time to track down and kill the party. His main escape route will be to break out of a window on the upper floor and fly away.
    * Possessions:
        * Dimir mirror that reveals the truth of Dimir secret messages. "Plain looking mirror with a faded brass back, small enough to comfortably fit in the palm of your hand."

* The safehouse looks like an efficiently-used above-commercial living quarters, with a neat pair of sturdy bunk-beds, a utilitarian cast-iron stove in the center for heat and cooking, a table, several shelving units with a variety of gear for spycraft (grappling hooks, a pair of spyglasses, throwing weapons, crossbow bolts, and arrows, small sticks of charcoal and ledgers for taking notes, etc), and the desk that Vessmer was seated at when you entered.
    * The desk contains a variety of above and underground maps, as well as writing equipment and several large folders of paper, most of which seem to be related to the press shop below. Invoices and tally sheets for orders of various manuscripts, advertisement flyers, and the like. *INT 15* will reveal that there seem to be additional orders inserted that aren't accounted for in the financial logs. These order tend to appear to be of social/political rather than obviously commercial nature.
    * Wis 10 will find a false bottom to one of the drawers with a sheet of parchment in it. It has a series of messages written in it that none of you can read. *Int 12* reveals that as far as you know this isn't a real, or at least publicly known language. Casting detect magic will also reveal that the paper itself has faint traces of magic. Upon looking at the parchment in the mirror the Dimir spell obscuring the runes will be penetrated and you can read "We are most pleased of your progress, and concur that a scaling up of the operation would be best to continue within the cathedral; the risk of trying to move all of the biomancer, her equipment, and her subjects to a more accessible location raises the risk of detection to unacceptable levels. Secrecy still outweighs convenience until we are fully ready to initiate the project. We will present Lazav with a specimen next month; you are instructed to have one ready for transfer, reply in the usual way when it's done. Do not dawdle."
