# Act 1
## Scene 1 - Discover the Crime
    
> Life in Ravnica was a great deal calmer now that the planeswalker Jace had accepted the mantle of the "The Living Guildpact" and the ten guilds had dialed preparations for all-out war back to their normal levels of politicking, subterfuge, and assassination. Still, life on the plane was never what you would call "safe", certainly not in Precinct 6, which was probably why Dante operated his now full-time private eye business out of it. Tonight, however, the ex-Boros investigator was out in the drizzle for personal reasons: an urgent message from his oldest friend.

```
Dante,
    I haven't much time; I'm in trouble and I need your help. I owe a lot to our old masters, they really don't give up on a debt, do they? Don't worry, I've got a way to pay it off, I found something they'd pay dearly for, enough for my debt and then some. But at this point I don't know if I'll live long enough to pay it, something's been following me, I don't know what, but it's always there, just out of sight. I need friend to watch my back, and once I get paid I'll make it worth your while. I know you're not with them, you're the only one I can trust. If I can count on you meet me by our old begging spot tomorrow night. Last I heard you had signed on with the Legion; hope you picked up some tricks from those angels.
-Aeranor
```

>The "begging spot" across the way from the Lamplighter Tavern, as boys Aeranor & Dante had harvested a mostly-voluntary stream of alms-coins from the lamplighters and other working stiffs that arrived in the hours after dusk when their work was done. Indeed, the the streets are now lit and lighters are beginning to trickle in as **Dante** sits by the window, unsure of what to expect...

## Discover the Body

* Tom can choose to interrogate the few bar patrons (several lamplighters loudly playing cards and a schmoozing couple) and barkeep for information about Aeranor, though he has little to go on, no updated description since he last saw him two decades ago. Upon asking the barkeep and providing a decent description the barkeep will tell him that he saw someone sounding something like that having a drink alone the night before but hadn't seen him tonight.

* Since he knows the area well from having spent his childhood in the orphanage near here Tom can choose to search the area to look for his friend. If he succeeds in a `INVESTIGATION 15` check he will find Aeranor in time to hear his dying words: `Not the damn ghosts...` If he chooses to wait first or fails the check he will be alerted by screams, shortly followed by a Selesnya patrol running by.

> In what is a familiar scene for a Wojek investigator you see a haggard (and dead) elf lying face-down in a narrow alley off of a small merchant's lane. His clothes have certainly seen better days, his dark hair has not been properly tended to in quite some time, and even for a wood elf he looks thin. A pair of daggers rest, apparently unused, in their hip sheaths, while a faint whisp of smoke curls up from the blasted hole in his back that obviouslly killed him. A small crowd of gawkers is beginning to gather, torn between curiosity at the death and fear that lingering too long might grant them a similar fate.

### Crime Scene Clues

* **Aeranor's Belongings**: Any investigation of the body will reveal 3d6 zibs with 1d6 each zinos and Orzhov alms coins. The unsigned note reads: `I've managed to secure leniency for you thus far, but even my patience is at its end. Tomorrow, noon, at the Milanian Chapel.` 
    * `Religion - 12`: The Milanian Chapel is a smaller Orzhov church on the edge of the precinct that has of late been mostly passed over in favor of a new, larger church nearby. It is also uncomfortably close to The Gore House and thus Rakdos territory.

* Body: Elaborate on description of body: facedown, very grubby, blast hole through body over heart area, very obviously looks unnatural.
    * `INVESTIGATION - 13` (light mucus/slime on Aeranor's gloves & forearms) will lead party a few yards away to where a small krasis is hiding behind a stack of empty casks.
    * `ARCANA - 13` determines that the wound was magical in origin

* Gawkers: pair of lamplighter-looking scruffy human males, middle aged, an apparently orphan elf girl, street merchant woman w/ small cart of wares. Lamplighters loudly 
    * `Persuasion - 10` gets girl to say she saw "rag man" running away. no description beyond big/scary/rags/couldn't see face. Follow her directions points you down a left turn alley that runs into a crosstreet. Traffic is low and no one appears to have seen anyone matching the description. 
        * `INVESTIGATION/PERCEPTION - 13` leads to a gaggle(3) of goblins all loudly tugging and pulling over a brass and gold stick that appears to be a wand.
            * `PERSUASION - 15 / INTIMIDATION - 13` - to get them to give you the wand, goblins can also be bribed to lower persuasion DC
            * if persuasion/intimidation fails they have a [50/50 chance of attacking and trying to rob you.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/1f7743a4-1e13-4883-b3eb-aae87d48daf3)
            * Wand: Brass inlaid with gold, this appears to be a manacrystal charged wand. At the end of the roughly footlong baton there is a small wire cage wrapped around a spent (cracked and dull) mana crystal. The wand itself is still very vaulable and with additional crystal could be rendered operational again. `ARCANA - 15` lets the party member know which area(where is the wand shop?) that is known for producing this kind of wand.


* **Krasis**: A `PERCEPTION 15` (sound, faint mix of croaking and chirping) will lead party to discover the krasis. The krasis is young and still imprinting, it will return to look at Aeranor's body but will attach itself strongly to the first party member to treat it kindly, especially if they offer it food.

> Roughly a foot long, this krasis appears to be some sort of frog-bird hybrid. Its head and body resemble that of sleek amphibian, complete with bulging yellow eyes and a long tongue perfect for snatching anything from insects to an unlucky faerie out of the air. Instead of crouching down on all fours as a frog would, it is perched back on its hind, webbed feet that inexplicibly also feature curling, grasping talons. In place of forelegs a pair of feathered wings is sprouting out of its shoulders, just as you begin to wonder whether the creature is capable of flight it gives a few flaps and with somewhat-questionable grace propels itself up onto the tallest cask, the better to cock its head at you and let out another inquisitive croak/chirp.

## Moving On

*Party can decide to either followup on lead from the note (head to chapel) or wand info (head to wand shop). Either will have to wait for the following day since it is now well after dark and those places are closed/no one will be there at present.
