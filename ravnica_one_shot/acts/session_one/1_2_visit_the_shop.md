# Session 1
## Scene 2 - Visit the shop

>In the middle of the next morning the party reconvenes several miles north, in the comparatively wealthy streets of the 5th. Simic territory. Izzet territory. *Nerd* territory. `Izoter` the back of the wand had enscribed, and `Izoter's Manastatic Devices Discount Emporium` was known to anyone with even a passing interest in League business. Emporium might suggest a grand bazaar when the interior that you stand in suggests "crammed used bookshop". Indeed, Izoter's was pretty much a bookshop except instead of paperbacks the shelves were crammed with devices that all largely came to the same explosive end, and from the looks of it half of them did in the last 24 hours. The goblin himself hasn't had the time to speak to you, as he's in the middle of a series of wild gesticulations with a smartly-dressed... satyr? Is that a satyr here on Ravnica? I probably shouldn't even say the word satyr because half of you provincial fucks don't even know what the hell a satyr is, huh? Sorry Will I'll let you introduce yourself.

Will introduces himself

> The goblin is wildly gesticulating at the general unintentional havoc that has been wreaked on his shop and begins cutting Topher off mid-sentence.
    `Are you completely out of your mind? Are you *kidding* me? I'm calling you here because you jerks say "I'm the law, make your wares available to non-corporeal customers or pay a ghost descrimination tax" and now when I need you because some of Krenko's boys jacked my shop you need to see the last *ten* years of my taxes?`


* Izoter Dialogue
    * Talking with him will reveal that his shop was busted up early two evenings ago not long after he had closed for the night. He had gone out himself to source some wares and his assistant <I HAVE NO INFO FROM VINCE> had also left for the night *Why the hell would he do that!*. Gets increasingly upset and blame it more on Vince, so that by the end he fires him.
        * Says that people he talked to in the neighborhood put it on a couple (3) of goblins, talked kind of like they were in Krenko's mob or maybe just independent toughs. Says it all took about 5 minutes tops, people didn't notice anything at first and then there was just a few minutes of noise and laughing as shit was being thrown around and smashed, then they ran off when a few people had started to gather. Looked like they were heading off back south towards Precinct Six. They were all carrying things in their hands that all looked like weapons, clubs, torches, etc.
        * Can't discover if anything was stolen besides the day-to-day cash for making change (<300g and insured) but it's possible with all of the destruction that he's overlooking something.
        * Says he's been here from half an hour after it happened until now trying to sort things out, figure out inventory, WAIT FOR THE AZORIUS INVESTIGATORS TO TAKE THEIR SWEET FUCKING TIME AND THEN START GRILLING HIM ON HIS FUCKING TAXES THOSE BIRDFUCKERS. Anyways, didn't notice anything strange since arriving. Oh and <VINCE>? Took their sweet time and showed up half an hour after despite being given notice at most twenty-four minutes after so what happened to those six minutes <VINCE>? Don't care about your place of employment <VINCE>?

* Investigation
    * Shop appears "a mess". Wands, engines, energy storage devices, just out-and-out explosives, it's only due to a literal, actual miracle as included in `Izoter's` leasing arrangement, a permanent aura of extracted angelic intervention that costs enough to sate an Orzhov prelate's gold addiction for potentially an entire day, that saved the whole place from going up. Nothing really to discover other than the obvious: these goblins smashed the place up, potentially/probably took the wand, and left.

## Moving On

* Party will start to head back to the 6th Precint in time for the dusk meeting at the chapel.
