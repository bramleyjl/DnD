Session 6 Recap

The suspiciously vampire-like Vessmer wasted no time in exerting some sort of weird control over Ribbard, turning his eyes black and siccing him on his hippie paladin buddy. The party, however, was made of stronger stuff than Vessmer had anticipated, and after some swordcane thwacks and dagger stabs and he was on the defensive, creating mirror images and fleeing for the exits. Topher quickly reacted with a dramatic "jump through the second-floor glass window like an action movie badass" to cut off his escape into the street, to which Vessmer responded with a  "jump through the first-floor glass window like a somewhat less badass action movie star" before flying away, outlined in pink faerie fire and at (un)death's door. The proprietor gone and Ribbard returned to its normal, croak-and-chill self, the party turned their attention to tossing the joint to find clues. Dante rifled through Vessmer's personal desk and discovered a false bottom that contained seemingly blank pages while Gitsum repeated his skillful "fuck the lock, I'm breaking this thing" trademark style to a lockbox and came away with a simple hand mirror. Observing the pages in the reflection of the mirror revealed that Vessmer was another link up the (presumably Dimir) chain and had been tasked with delivering a specimen so that a "Lazav" could observe it personally. The messages also revealed the existance of a "cathedral" in the Rubblebelt (NOT SVOGTHOS) as the base of whatever operation the bad guys were up to. With their next lead in hand, the party trekked the distance out of the civilized parts of Ravnica and now find themselves in the wilds, where they hope to finally have all of their krasis-related conspiracy questions laid to rest at last.....
