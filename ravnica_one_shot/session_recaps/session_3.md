The party followed Penaleus' directions to Keever's Kleavers and made a beeline straight to the bartender Keever, who quickly recognized their Krasis companion "Ribbird" and told them what he knew of Areanor: down on his luck (and roughing it in Gruul territory - party didn't ask), in debt to the Orzhov and recently in possession of a krasis. Further questions (with some silver) revealed that the krasis had been in his possession a few times, the least of which he had been drunk, very scared, and going on about how "they would own them all" and "it didn't matter if it was this fucker or the next fucker or any of them, it would be the end of them". The interview and inspection of the premises lasted straight into the opening act of a Rakdos show, and just as the party was beginning to make their exit Dante noticed a strange, shawled woman staring at him and trying to avoid his notice. Beginning pursuit, he was immediately charmed into volunteering to lose a finger as the first participant/victim of the show, and all hell broke loose with a flurry knives. After a lot of stabbing Gitsum generously managed to somehow turn the crowd and the Rakdos blade jugglers to his side with the promise of free booze for the entire crowd while Dante, Topher, and Telith engaged in an extended chase that finally lead to Dante catching up to the woman/gas cloud/Man in Rags and bludgeoning them into unconciousness.
