Party began inspecting the chapel, Telith & Topher were outside when Penaleus arrived. After brief conversation where Penaleus revealed that he was seeking Areanor for the 350g debt he claimed he was owed and noting the presence of their krasis companion Penaleus demanded either the money itself or possession of the krasis and directions to Areanor's wereabouts. When the party refused he decided to attack, but was quickly overcome and knocked unconcious from Dante's quick cane work combined with Topher's effective use of a silencing spell; the thrulls were then bludgeoned and stabbed to death. Party dragged Penaleus' unconcious body into the chapel, took a short rest, then woke him up and intimidated the shit out of him to get him to reveal additional information: namely that this krasis was going to be handed over in place of the debt because it would come with some (unknown) secret that made it valuable somehow, and that they could maybe get more information on Areanor by visiting `Keaver's Kleavers`, where Penaleus had visited him to harangue him about the debt before. Topher then put his pan flute to work and called in a pair of Azorius arrester buddies to make the official collar of Penaleus, which after some hot legal wrangling vis a vis the precise location of the inciting attack and whether or not that would make the crime to have occurred on diocese property or not, everyone agreed to hang around and make detailed statements (3-5 hours, tops) so that the arrest and charges could be made BY THE BOOK.
